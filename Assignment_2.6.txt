1) Write a program to accepts two numbers from stdin and find all the odd as well as even
numbers present in between them.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class acad {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("From number:");
  	int a= sc.nextInt();
  	System.out.print("To number:");
	int b= sc.nextInt();
	acad a1 = new acad();
	System.out.println("Even Numbers");
    for(int i=a;i<=b;i++){
    	
    	if(i%2==0){
        System.out.println(i);  		
    	}
    }
    System.out.println("Odd Numbers");
    for(int j=a;j<=b;j++){
    	if(j%2!=0){
    		System.out.println(j);
    	}
    }
	}

}

Output:
From number:2
To number:10
Even Numbers
2
4
6
8
10
Odd Numbers
3
5
7
9

2) Joe is scared to go to school. When her dad asked the reason, joe said she is unable to
complete the task given by her teacher. The task was to find the “first 10 multiples” of the
number entered from stdin.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class acad {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("input:");
  	int input= sc.nextInt();
	for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
		System.out.println(input+" x "+i+" = "+(input*i));
	}
	}
}

Output:

input:3
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30

3) Write a program consisting method sum() and demonstrate the concept of method
overloading using this method.

public class acad {
	public void sum(int a1, int a2){
		 int sum=0;
		 sum = a1+a2;
			System.out.println("Sum of "+a1+" and "+a2+" is "+sum);

	}
	public void sum(int a1,int a2, int a3){
		int sum=0;
		sum=a1+a2+a3;
		System.out.println("Sum of "+a1+","+a2+" and "+a3+" is "+sum);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
    acad a = new acad();
	a.sum(10,11);
	a.sum(10, 11, 12);
	}

}

Output:

Sum of 10 and 11 is 21
Sum of 10,11 and 12 is 33
